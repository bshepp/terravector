# Spectral Configuration
# Directional FFT signatures for detecting oriented terrain features
#
# Use cases:
# - Linear feature detection (ridges, valleys, drainage networks)
# - Oriented texture patterns (agricultural fields, geological structures)
# - Man-made infrastructure (roads, field boundaries)
